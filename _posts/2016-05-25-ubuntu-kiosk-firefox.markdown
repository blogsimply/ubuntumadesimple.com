If you want to install a public kiosk in a public place like a hotel lobby, there are great options out there like [Porteus Kiosk](http://porteus-kiosk.org/) that are pre-built and hardened Linux distros made specifically for public use.  However, sometimes you just want a quick kiosk to use at home or in a trusted work environment. Here's a quick and easy way to launch Firefox in full-screen mode and turn a standard Ubuntu desktop into a simple web kiosk. 

You could make a separate user for kiosk mode to keep friends and family from messing up your main account. You could also look at automatically clearing history and resetting settings when Firefox is launched. The instructions in this video will get you started, but your imagination is the limit when it comes to customizing Ubuntu!
